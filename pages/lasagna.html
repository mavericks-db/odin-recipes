        <h3>This is a photo of Brenda's Lasagna.</h3>
        <p><strong>Lasagna</strong> is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually
            rectangular or ribbon
            shaped,
            thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After
            being boiled,
            the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on
            different local
            traditions.</p>
