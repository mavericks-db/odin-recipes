        <h3>This is a photo of Pesto Pizza.</h3>
        <p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened
            wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,
            cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat,
            etc.), which
            is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a
            pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
