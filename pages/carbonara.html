        <h3>This is a photo of Chicken Carbonara.</h3>
        <p><strong>Carbonara</strong> is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese,
            cured pork, and
            black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th
            century.
            The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is
            the most
            common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta
            are used for
            the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy</p>

            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>8 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
                    occasionally, until
                    tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add pancetta and garlic;
                    saute until brown and
                    crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and parsley together in a large bowl until well blended.
                </li>
                <li>Stir chicken into the pancetta mixture until combined. Add cooked spaghetti and cream mixture. Toss
                    over medium-low heat
                    until chicken is heated through and sauce forms a thick coating over the spaghetti, about 4 minutes.
                    Do not boil or the
                    eggs will scramble. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, wide serving bowl.</li>
            </ol>
